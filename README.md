# Harden FreeBSD 

![](images/harden-freebsd-logo.jpg)

FreeBSD officially defaults to [Permanently Insecure Mode](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=security&sektion=7&manpath=freebsd-release#SECURING_THE_KERNEL_CORE,_RAW_DEVICES,_AND_FILE%09SYSTEMS). This script will duplicate all the hardening settings run by `/usr/libexec/bsdinstall/hardening` and much more. Any directive can be set and re-set with a customizable `settings.ini` for administering, tuning, and easier jail management. All existing entries in all confs will remain untouched unless they are modified in the settings file.

This script is also targeted to new users of FreeBSD so that they may leverage years of security contributions by the entire BSD community across all spectra, implemented on thier system in seconds.

Each of the security settings was researched, assessed, and chosen as a set of mitigations for maximizing threat reduction while minimizing restriction of system capability and availability.

### Zenbleed Workaround
* *I could only do very limited testing on VM's, please submit issues!*
* [Security Engineer's Discovery & Write-Up](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html)
* [Affects AMD Zen 2 Chipset Family](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/07/26/zenbleed-how-the-quest-for-cpu-performance-could-put-your-passwords-at-risk/)
* Mitigation/workaround suggested by discovering Security Engineer **will not work in Virtual Machines**
* AMD has patched the Rome family, server oriented series, of CPU's but all others are expected in December of 2023.
* The command to manually verify the chicken-bit has been set is `cpucontrol -m "0xc0011029" /dev/cpuctl0`

#### Zenbleed Features
* Sets the Model Specific Register chicken-bit exactly as suggested by the discovering Security Engineer
* Patches the latest AMD microcode from [Platomov's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/platomav/CPUMicrocodes/tree/master/AMD) if available for your Zen2 CPU, currently, only "Rome" series as of August 11, 2023.
* If in a Virtual Machine, check for EPYC Rome series CPU and apply AMD patch and exit if not Rome, as there is no other patch available yet and Hypervisor disallows the workaround.
* Only if a Zenbleed vulnerable CPU is detected a CPU chicken-bit is be set every boot via a provided rc script
* Prompts to make a reminder to remove the script using `at` to create a file called `REMINDER-AMD-Zenbleed-Removal` in home directory on the 2023 December Solstice


#### Execute
* `cd util`
* `chmod 750 zenbleed-workaround.csh`
* `sudo ./zenbleed-workaround.csh`

#### Arguments
* `./zenbleed-workaround.csh clean` removes the CPU microcode/firmware utilities as a security measure once Zenbleed patching is complete
    * Do not use `clean` if you still need the workaround on baremetal as it uses cpucontrol.
* `./zenbleed-workaround.csh remove` removes the rc script for performance reasons or once the patch is applied from AMD in Decemeber 2023. 
    * In the case of an AMD Zenbleed fully patched CPU, follow `remove` with `clean` for security purposes.

# Main Details

## Requirements
* FreeBSD 13.1, 13.2
* Python 3.9.16


## Installation

**WARNING: Once kernel level 1 is set by this script, you will not be able to modify these confs again with this script until it is set to -1 and rebooted!**

* Set `kernlevel = -1` if you want to test various setting groups with your applications and network
* Customize `settings.ini`  to whatever is needed, the script will change the directive to your flag
* Set permissions `chmod 750 harden-freebsd.py` to prevent shell injection from another account or process
* Set permissions `chmod 640 settings.ini` to prevent shell injection from another account or process
* No `settings.ini` section can be entirely commented out nor be completely empty
* `sudo ./harden-freebsd.py`


## Conf File Verification

`kern.vty = "vt"`

This script does primitive verification of the confs flags in strict accordance with system man. Many online tutorials even on the FreeBSD family of websites do not use the proper syntax. Check the log for any validation failures. Use proper syntax, remove the syntax checking lines 241-261, or rewrite the regular expression to make a new check suitable for you.

* For `/etc/sysctl.conf` the script checks for no quotes
* For `/boot/loader.conf` the script strictly verifies syntax from man and `/boot/defaults/loader.conf` syntax
    * All directives in these sister confs must be in quotes

If you do get stuck in read-only single-user mode and need to correct a configuration file then use:

```sh
zfs set readonly=false zroot
zfs mount -a
```

## Customization

#### 64bit vs 32bit
Most tunable mitigations for 64bit are already included by default in FreeBSD 13.1 so 32bit directives were included for coverage. I can see no affect from setting the 32bit mitigations on 64bit systems, they are simply ignored. For clarity on unknown hardware, hardware mode, VM, or cloud use the following commands:
* CPU: `sysctl hw.model hw.machine hw.ncpu`
* Bits: `getconf LONG_BIT`


#### Backups

The very first time the script is run it will make copies of `rc.conf`, `sysctl.conf`, `login.conf`, and `loader.conf` named `rc.conf.original` etc. If you've already done this yourself you may want to rename or move those files.

If you would like you can set `settings.ini` section `[SCRIPT]`option `first_run` to `True` with capital `T` to make new backups at any time after you've renamed the original backups or the script will overwrite them.


#### Chmod-ability

The set of files needed to be secure changed and changed throughout testing and so it ended up as a shell command but an error checked function was provided for the administrator programmer to use instead of appending to the long list in `settings.ini` section `[FILESEC]` if you wish or to work with other software.

Those files are:

`etc/ftpusers /etc/group /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.equiv /etc/hosts.lpd /etc/inetd.conf /etc/login.access /etc/login.conf /etc/newsyslog.conf /etc/rc.conf /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/sysctl.conf etc/syslog.conf /etc/ttys /etc/crontab /usr/bin/crontab /usr/bin/at /usr/bin/atq /usr/bin/atrm /usr/bin/batch /var/log`

#### Secure Password Settings

The newly applied settings will not take affect until you reset your password.

---

#### Automatic Jail Lockdown/Management Strategies

1. Set the correct paths to jailed confs in `harden-freebsd.py` lines 32-38 and run for each jail.
2. Copy software to `/root` and have jail start this script at reboot and all settings will be updated upon next reboot. To update all jails simply copy `settings.ini` with your own copy script to all appropriate locations for uptake. 

`crontab -e`

`@reboot /path/to/harden-freebsd.py`

3. Have all jails pointing to the same rc script via `exec.start` and set paths in the script pointing to the same location modified by the script paths. 
4. Add new jail specific entires to `settings.ini [SYSTEM]` section for sysctl.conf udpate
   - `security.jail.* = 0`
5. Use mutiple copies of the script and settings.ini for each jail
6. Put it in your template

### August 11, 2023 Changelog
* The rc script has been updated for better performance and stability 
    * There is no positive value cases I can find for removing the chicken-bit during operation which on the contrary may produce unexpected results as with other workarounds of this type
    * Rebooting without the rc script running returns the OS to an unset chicken-bit state which obviates the need to have a `rc` chicken-bit removal function. 
        * The user chooses the workaround or not without the rc script making available CPU state changes while in operation possibly inducing kernel panics
        * Simply using the `remove` argument and rebooting will return the AMD Zenbleed vulnerability -> MSR state to default
* Fixed Syntax errors and word clarity in the main workaround file
* Added a prompted reminder function using `at` to create a file in the home directory reminding the user to use the official patch due at that time and remove the workaround


*Full [Changelog](Changelog.md)*
